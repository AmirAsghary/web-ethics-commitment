# {{title}}

The following directives represent an early draft of possibilities for our web professional code of ethics. They are a combination of various shared concepts across [other similar efforts](https://github.com/DrunkenUX/web-ethics-commitment/blob/main/src/index.md#helpful-resources), as well as original statements. Provide feedback by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/DrunkenUX/web-ethics-commitment/issues) to the GitHub repo, or [visit us on Discord](https://drunkenux.com/discord). 
  
**TO DO:** This page will eventually be merged into the [index.md file](https://github.com/DrunkenUX/web-ethics-commitment/blob/main/src/index.md). It will remain separate during drafting. (Perhaps leave separate and include into the template as a partial.)
  
## Context for Principles
  
When thinking about what is and is not being included in the list, we are considering the following:
  
* They should be role agnostic. Designers, developers, testers, researchers, etc. all have a hand in creating web experiences, and we want them to all feel committed to these principles.
* We're intentionally leaving out coverage of things like business practices. While you should still *definitely* engage in business practices ethically, the business side is a different coin, so-to-speak.
  
## Our Principles

1. I will advocate for users that don't have a voice in our process
2. I will promote the creation of products that are highly accessible to any user, regardless of their technology or abilities
3. I will honor the intellectual property rights of other creators, and apply proper credit and licenses to creations that make my work possible
4. I will not mislead, trick, or manipulate users of my work through the use of hostile design (a.k.a. dark patterns) 
5. I will build products that respect the user's privacy, give them control over the use of their data, secure the data we store about them, and make it easy for them to leave or close their account
6. I will not fascilitate the creation of products designed to cause direct harm to society or individuals
7. I will be respectful of my peers and users, and offer guidance and assistance when possible.
